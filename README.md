### Recommendation system for cooking recipes

This project offers a journey in the world of recommendation systems. It covers various methods known as state of the art 
- Content Based Filtering
- Collaborative Filtering
- Matrix Factorization
- Hybrid system
- AutoEncoder 

It applies them on a specific use case, that is the recommendation of recipes for the food.com website. Note that we do not stop at their individual implementation and comparison, we also combine them cleverly to address some well known issues of recommender systems: lack of ratings, cold start prob- lem, unbalanced distribution of ratings, etc. In each case, we propose a list of ten robust recommendations to the user while distinguishing between active users and passive users or fresh joiners.
